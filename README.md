# DeSalvoDubiniGrossoni

# Installation
We decided to split the main 4 projects in separate branches
1 - DeSalvoDubiniGrossoni -> Documents
2 - Front-end -> eMSP + CPMS website
3 - Back-end -> eMSP backend
4 - CPMS-Back-end -> CPMS backend

## Git worktree
In order to setup the repo we strongly suggest to use git worktree and setup different folders to run each branch independently

```bash
1] - Clone the main repo
2] - Inside the main repo execute
git worktree add ../emall_backend Back-end
git worktree add ../emall_frontebd Front-end
git worktree add ../cpms_backend CPMS-Back-end

This should create three separate folders that you can now open independently

3] - Follow the instruction inside the README of each branch

```
