    \section{Introduction}
        \emph{Electric mobility} (e-Mobility) is a way to reduce the carbon footprint caused by motorized vehicles in urban and sub-urban areas.\\
        % One way to do so while using an electric vehicle is to fit and optimize the charging process into our daily schedule
        Comfortably knowing how to fit the charging process into one's daily schedule is a fundamental step towards that goal.
        
    \subsection{Purpose} %goals of the project

        %One of the biggest drawbacks of electric vehicles is the toll the charging process takes in terms of time. So on and so forth
         
        In the last 3 years the number of electric vehicles has doubled and, with the proposed european legislation on banning diesel fuel by 2035, the future seems to be full-electric. This rapid change requires a better and more efficient infrastructure to serve this ever increasing demand.

        %In these years the number of electric vehicles has been on the rise and, as it is expcted to be quadrupled by 2050, a better working infrastructure for them is needed.
        
        %Electric vehicles will quadruple in the next 5 years. As of now, having to charge your car in the middle of the day can prove to be a very daunting task

        \emph{eMall} (e-Mobility for all) aims to ease the charging process for the users through the \emph{e-Mobility Service Provider's} (eMSP) platform,
        providing all the needed end-users' services and by actively communicating with multiple \emph{Charging Point Operators'} (CPOs) \emph{Management Systems} (CPMS).

                \item He inserts all the required information in the mandatory fields and presses the "Confirm" button
                \item The system verifies that the mail has not been used before. After passing the verification a confirmation e-mail is sent to mister Fontana's mailbox
                \item He checks his mailbox to see if he received the confimation e-mail
            \end{itemize}
                
            \item Mister Brambilla is about to finish a meeting and is about to have a 2 hour break. eMall detects that he's about to go on break, and it sends him an e-mail suggesting him to charge his car
            \begin{itemize}
                \item He receives an e-mail suggesting him to charge his car 
                \item He logs on the eMall webapp
                \item The eMall webapp suggests the closest chargers and the ones with eventual discounts
                \item Brambilla selects his preferred charging station and books it
                \item eMall prompts a link to help Brambilla get there
                \item Brambilla opens the link and heads there
            \end{itemize}

            \item Mister Fontana is on vacation and since he's new to the area he wants to know which charging stations are nearby
            \begin{itemize}
                \item He opens the web application and logs-In
                \item He navigates to the interactive map section
                \item He clicks the "current position" button
                \item He gets notified by the web application that his GPS position is not turned on
                \item He turns on the GPS and then searches all the nearby stations by simply clicking the "current position" button and viewing the map 
                
            \end{itemize}
            
            \item Miss Sala will go to the hairdresser next sunday. She knows that in the parking lot near the hairdresser there's a charging station and she wants to make sure that a spot will be available that day, so she decides to book a spot for that charging station
            \begin{itemize}
                \item She opens the web application and logs-In
                \item She selects the "Book a spot" option
                \item She compiles the requested fields with date, time of arrival and location and selects confirm
                \item The system checks if a charging spot for that date and time is still available, in that case a confirmation message is shown and the booking is saved. If no spot is still available an "unsuccesful booking" message is shown and the booking is aborted
                \item After successfully booking a spot the system sends a mail with a recap of the booking 
                \item Miss Sala after reaching the charging station on the booked timeframe unlocks the booked charging spot via the web app and can start the starting process
            \end{itemize}
            
            \item Mister Ferrari has booked a charging spot for saturday. He realizes that he has lost the keys to his car, and will not make it in time. While he searches for his keys he forgets to delete the reservation.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The system locks the charging spot while waiting for mister Ferrari
                \item 5 minutes after the booked time, if the reservated user doesn't show up, the charging spot is unlocked and the reservation is cancelled
                \item Other users can now start using the previously reserved charging spot
            \end{itemize}

            \item Mister Rana wants to start the charging process and pay, since he's arrived at the booked station near his office
            \begin{itemize}
                \item He opens the web application and logs-In
                \item He navigates to the "booking list" section
                \item He plugs-in the charging cable to the car 
                \item He selects the right station and clicks the "start charging" button
                \item He's then asked to pay inside the web app and he pays with his credit card
                \item He finally sees that the car has started to charge
                \item When the charging ends he gets notified by the application
            \end{itemize}

                \item He plans his trip inside the navigation system or the in-app map
                \item He then sorts the charging stations by the charging price and the special offers
                \item He books the cheaper ones that covers the right amount of distance from each other
            \end{itemize}
            
            \item Mister Lamborghini wants to delete his booked charge since his schedule changed and he can no longer make it there in time.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item He opens the web-application and he logs-In
                \item On the webapp he opens his "bookings list"

        \subsubsection{Class diagram}
        \label{class_diagram}
            In the UML diagram there are described all the main entities in the system.
            We can see that the system is composed by 2 main actors: the \textit{User} and the \textit{CPO}.\\
            The user owns an \textit{E-car} and can book a charging spot, while the charging station is the entity that provides the charging service.\\
            Data regarding the charging stations and the sockets are provided by the CPMS \textit{OCPI API} which is used by the \textit{Booking}, \textit{Charging Process} and \textit{Charging station} entities to retrive or send all the needed information, and that is implemented inside the CPMS subsystem.\\
            There's also an entity for the \textit{Socket} in order to store the information about the socket's status and his price, and another one for the \textit{Offer} that can be applied to all the charging stations owned by the same CPO.\\
            Information about the Users' daily schedule are represented inside the \textit{Calendar Schedule} and the the \textit{Event} entity, that use the \textit{Calendar API} to retrive the user's appointments.\\
            There's also an interface for the \textit{Payment} that can be implemented by different payment methods.

    \section{Specific Requirements}
    
    \subsection{External Interface Requirements}

    \subsubsection{User Interfaces}
    Users should interface the web application through devices that must be connected to the Internet. The service will be accessed through a web browser from the web site domain (i.g. www.eMall.com).
    As the service will be used by a lot of different kinds of users, the web application interface should be as simple and intuitive as possible.
    

    \subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
    \label{hardware_interfaces}
    Since the system provides a web application, there's not an hardware interface. 
    In order to give a complete experience, the system should be given the access/permission to the user's GPS position or navigation system.  

    \subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
    \label{software_interfaces}
    To access the application a web browser is required. Additional software like a calendar and GPS is necessary for accessing all the funcionalities of the application. The software will also take advantage of some interfaces to accomplish its requirements. An external API is necessary to visualize on maps the user location and the near charging stations. %frase copiatissima%
    
    \subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
    Internet connections will be mandatory since the web application must communicate with the web server and the CPMS APIs.
    Communication with the CPMS will be ASYNCRONOUS/etc..

    \section{Formal Analysis using Alloy}
    \subsection{Formal Analysis Purpose}
    The following analysis aims to formally prove the correctness of the system model by exploiting Alloy verification tool. To achieve so, we test the model by checking if some of the previous defined goals are met. 

    Specifically, we stress:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{(G3) }: 
        
    \end{itemize}

    Plus, we runned some empty predicates \texttt{show} to generate some more general instances of the app system.
